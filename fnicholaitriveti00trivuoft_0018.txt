§ 3. The other work» os Trivet are nume-

has been caused by his biographers in citing,
under different titlee, works which are identieal.
They make, sor instance, three worka out ot·
his one Chronicle os the History os the World ς
they deprive him os the authorship os others, by

arrangement have given a sun catalogue of all
the works that have been attributed to him, at
the same time judiciously receiving with doubt
euch as they could not determine with certainty,
and giving means sor investigation by referring
to various MSS. abroad, and in the Royal Library
at Paris. It ie here amply sufficient sor our pre-

sent purpose to notice a few, which we have
examined, and had the means os determiuing.
